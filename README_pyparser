The Python Parser is a Python/Django project that helps to make use of GLASNOST data for high-level research questions.

The projects helps in the following: 

	1. Extracting the main outcome or "verdict" from test logs. This is an update of the original algorithm provided by the authors, covering corner cases and "abnormal" tests.
	
	2. Adding historical based geo-leocation + ASN data

	3. Storing the output in SQL, easing making aggregated (ISP/country level) datasets.



Build & run steps are provided in a seperate file in the project.
